## Hospital Information System (HIS)
A Hospital Information System (HIS) is a comprehensive, integrated information system designed to manage the administrative, financial, and clinical aspects of a hospital. Its primary purpose is to streamline and automate the processes involved in patient care and hospital management, thereby improving efficiency, accuracy, and the quality of healthcare services
## Project Structure
This project is divided into two main directories: backend-HIS and frontend-HIS. Each directory contains subdirectories and files that are organized by their functionalities.

## Backend
The backend-HIS directory contains all server-side code, including configurations, controllers, models, routes, and the main Express application setup.

## Project Description
This Hospital Information System (HIS) project is designed to manage various aspects of a hospital's operations, including patient admissions, record maintenance, medical orders, medication management, billing, appointment scheduling, clinical support, administrative tasks, and reporting and analytics. The system is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), providing a robust and scalable solution for hospital management.

The backend handles all the server-side logic, including database interactions, business logic, and API endpoints. The frontend provides an intuitive and responsive user interface for hospital staff to interact with the system efficiently.
